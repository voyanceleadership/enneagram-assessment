[Type Summary]  
Nines are steady, adaptable individuals who excel at fostering harmony and bringing people together. While they avoid conflict to preserve peace, they also possess an inner strength and determination that shines through when they truly care about an issue or relationship.

[Long Description]  
Nines are driven by a desire to maintain peace and harmony, both internally and externally. They excel at mediating conflicts, bringing people together, and creating a calm environment. Nines have an innate ability to empathize with others, often seeing all sides of a situation. However, they may struggle with asserting their own needs and preferences, instead prioritizing the comfort and desires of others. At their best, Nines are grounded and empowering, bringing balance and compassion to their relationships and environment.

- You have a natural ability to mediate and see all sides of an argument.  
- You feel deeply affected by discord and strive to create a peaceful environment.  
- You’re adaptable and go along with others’ plans to avoid confrontation.

- You value comfort and may procrastinate on challenging or overwhelming tasks.

[Common Misconceptions About This Type]  
1. **Nines are always accommodating.**  
   While Nines aim to maintain harmony, they can be surprisingly stubborn about their wants, needs, or preferences. However, they often communicate these indirectly, hoping to gain agreement without direct confrontation.  

2. **All Nines are pushovers.**  
   This depends on their level of personal development. Average Nines may seem overly accommodating, but they still advocate for their desires—albeit subtly. Only at very low levels of functioning do Nines become true doormats.  

3. **Nines always avoid conflict.**  
   Nines will express their thoughts or preferences if they deeply care about an issue and trust the relationship. In close partnerships, this can even result in others jokingly noting how "not easygoing" the Nine truly is when it matters.  

4. **Nines are lazy or unproductive.**  
   Nines are often busy and productive, but they tend to avoid tasks or situations that feel emotionally challenging—such as difficult conversations or overwhelming projects—while focusing on less emotionally taxing activities.
