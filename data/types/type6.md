[Type Summary]  
Sixes are defined by their desire for security and support, often finding safety in planning, preparation, and loyal relationships. They are thoughtful, reliable, and team-oriented, but their desire to anticipate potential problems can lead to anxiety or overthinking. Sixes can present in two distinct ways: **phobic** Sixes avoid conflict and seek reassurance, while **counterphobic** Sixes tackle challenges head-on, sometimes appearing assertive or combative.

[Long Description]  
Sixes thrive on creating security and stability in their lives, often relying on detailed planning, preparation, and strong relationships to feel safe. They are loyal, reliable, and hardworking, deeply committed to their teams, families, and communities. Phobic Sixes seek reassurance and avoid conflict, while counterphobic Sixes confront challenges head-on, masking their underlying anxiety with assertiveness. While their vigilance and foresight can be assets, Sixes can struggle with self-doubt, overthinking, and excessive reliance on others for reassurance.

- You often seek reassurance to feel confident in your decisions.  
- You think extensively about worst-case scenarios.  
- You have a strong sense of responsibility to your team or loved ones.

- You’re willing to confront challenges if it feels necessary to mitigate risk.  
- You prefer clear rules and guidelines to ambiguity.  
- You’re highly attuned to your environment, scanning for potential threats.

- You feel comfortable making decisions quickly without extensive planning.  
- You prefer spontaneity to structure.  
- You don’t value loyalty or trust as highly in your relationships.

[Common Misconceptions About This Type]  
1. **All Sixes are great planners or highly responsible.**  
   While many Sixes rely on planning to create security, others focus more on relationships and loyalty, prioritizing interpersonal trust over meticulous preparation.  

2. **All Sixes are highly community-oriented.**  
   Some Sixes prefer self-reliance and risk management, appearing more like Types 1, 3, 5, or 8. These Sixes are often skeptical, withdrawn, and focused on solving problems independently rather than building community connections.  

3. **All Sixes present as anxious.**  
   Counterphobic Sixes tackle challenges assertively, appearing confident and bold. While their anxiety drives their behavior, it manifests as action and control rather than visible hesitation or worry.
