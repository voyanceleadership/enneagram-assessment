[Type Summary]
Ethical, reliable, and purposeful, Ones hold themselves to high standards and work diligently to make improvements in their world.

[Long Description]
Ones are principled, purposeful, self-controlled, and perfectionistic. They strive for improvement and are committed to acting ethically and responsibly. Ones focus on maintaining high standards and often feel compelled to correct errors, both in themselves and their environment. Their perfectionism can be both a strength and a challenge, as they navigate the tension between striving for excellence and embracing imperfection.

[You Might Be This Type If...]

- You’re clear on your principles and prioritize them in your decision-making.
- You’re always able to identify how something could be improved.
- You have extremely high standards for yourself and can be very self-critical.
- You have a tendency toward perfectionism.
- It can be difficult for you to see an error or a problem and not fix it.
- Doing things the “correct” way is important to you.
- You care about doing the right thing and doing things the right way.
- You sometimes (or often) feel frustrated that other people don’t have the same standards as you or that things aren’t the way they should be.
- You’ve gotten feedback that you can be nitpicky, critical, or send the message that nothing’s ever good enough.

- You rarely feel guilty about taking shortcuts.
- You don't have strong opinions about right and wrong.

[Common Misconceptions About This Type]
1. **All Ones are social crusaders.** While many social crusaders are Ones, many Ones are not social crusaders. What all Ones have in common is a desire to fix problems or issues and help things reach their potential, but this can show up in many forms. Some Ones focus their attention on social problems, while others focus on other aspects of life such as the quality of their work, improving themselves, or fixing problems that feel important to them.
2. **Ones are perfectionistic about everything.** A common misconception about Ones is that they strive for perfection in every aspect of their lives. For example, people often expect Ones to have a perfectly tidy home. While many Ones do keep their environment “spic and span,” some Ones can actually be quite messy. The caveat to the perfectionism of Ones is that they’ll be perfectionistic about the things they care about. If keeping their world perfectly organized is important to them, they’ll do it to a T – if it’s not, they’ll focus their efforts elsewhere.
