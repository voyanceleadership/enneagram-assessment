[Type Summary]  
Fours are introspective, emotionally honest, and uniquely creative, constantly seeking authenticity and meaning in their lives.

[Long Description]  
Fours are defined by their deep introspection and desire to connect with their inner truth. They thrive on emotional depth and self-expression, often seeing themselves as uniquely different from others. Fours are attuned to the beauty and complexity of the human experience, which inspires their creative pursuits and fuels their search for significance.

[Common Misconceptions About This Type]  
1. **All Fours are outwardly emotionally expressive.** While Fours deeply process their emotions, they may not always express them outwardly. Many Fours present as cheerful and social, reserving their deeper thoughts and feelings for those they trust and feel understood by.  
2. **Fours are always starving artists.** While Fours often gravitate toward creative fields, they aren’t confined to independent professions. Some thrive in corporate settings within creative roles (e.g., marketing) or industries (e.g., fashion). A Four with a Three wing may adapt well to larger organizations, while a Four with a Five wing might find fulfillment in professions that blend creativity with logic, such as architecture or computer science.  
3. **All Fours “look different.”** Fours often express their individuality through personal style, preferring unique or niche brands over mainstream options. However, this doesn’t always manifest in physical appearance. Some Fours prefer subtle ways to stand out, such as owning a distinctive car or focusing on less visible expressions of uniqueness.
