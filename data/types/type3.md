1. **All Threes are charming.** While some Threes are naturally charismatic, this depends on their level of social skill and how much emphasis they place on building relationships. Not all Threes prioritize charm as a path to success.
2. **Threes want to impress everyone.** Threes are selective about their audience. While some Threes aim to impress everyone, most focus on gaining admiration from people they respect, admire, or are close to.
3. **Threes always want to be in the spotlight.** Threes only want attention when they feel confident in their ability to perform or excel. If they think they’ll embarrass themselves (e.g., if they’re not skilled public speakers), they’re likely to avoid the spotlight.
