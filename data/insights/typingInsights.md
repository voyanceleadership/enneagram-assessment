## Enneagram Typing Insights for AI Analysis

### Analysis Guidance for AI Enneagram Interpretation

#### Leveraging Triads for Accurate Typing
- **Triads** form the basis of this assessment, enhancing accuracy beyond traditional tests like RHETI.
- Each Enneagram type is defined by a unique combination of:
  - **Center of Intelligence** (Head, Heart, Gut)
  - **Hornevian Group** (Assertive, Withdrawn, Dutiful)
  - **Harmonic Group** (Positive Outlook, Competency, Reactive)
  - **Object Relations** (Attachment, Frustration, Rejection)
- If a user scores highly on **all three types** within a triad, prioritize analysis of those types.
- Narrow down by comparing distinguishing characteristics among the triad types.
- The triads often explain why someone scores highly on a set of types - for example, when someone scores highly on Type 1 and Type 5, it's because they're both highly logical.

#### Resolving Conflicting Results
- When the user is torn between adjacent types (e.g., **7w8 vs 8w7** or **2 vs 9**), focus on:
  - **Wings and integration/disintegration lines** to highlight dominant patterns.
  - Examine behavioral patterns under stress and growth.

### Recognizing Type 6
- **Type 6** frequently scores similarly to **1s or 2s**.
- Indicators of Type 6 include:
  - Mentions of **risk assessment**
  - **Future planning and contingency thinking**
  - **Focus on security and preparedness**
- A combination of **Type 2 and Type 5** suggests a likelihood of Type 6.
- **Counter-phobic 6s** may score highly on Type 8, indicating assertiveness driven by fear.
- Recognize that Type 6 users are prone to **self-misidentification** and uncertainty.

### Addressing Common Mistypes
- Guide the AI to recognize frequent misidentifications:
  - **Type 3** mistyping as **8**
  - **Type 6** mistyping as **2 or 9**
  - **Type 1 vs Type 6**
  - **Type 2 vs Type 6**
  - **Type 3 vs Type 7**
  - **Type 5 vs Type 1**
  - **Type 2 vs Type 9**

---

### Handling Ambiguous or Extreme Scores
- **Ambiguous Scores**:
  - Flag cases where users display balanced traits across multiple types.
  - Assess cross-triad dominance to refine typing.
- **High Scores Across Multiple Types**:
  - Indicate strong resonance with several types or self-awareness.
  - Recommend further refinement by focusing on triads and lines.
- **Distinct Scoring Patterns**:
  - Prioritize analysis of consistently high scores within a specific triad.

---

### Continuous Improvement and Updates
- Regularly update AI analysis logic to reflect common mistypes.
- Incorporate patterns of misidentification into the algorithm for future assessments.
- Utilize user feedback to refine and enhance interpretive accuracy over time.
