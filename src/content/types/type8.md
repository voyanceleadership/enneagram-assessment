[Common Misconceptions About This Type]  
1. **Eights are always angry or aggressive.**  
   While Eights are assertive and unafraid of confrontation, their strength comes from a place of protection and advocacy. They are not inherently angry or aggressive but may appear so when defending themselves or others.  

2. **Eights don’t have feelings.**  
   Eights feel deeply but often suppress or hide their emotions to avoid appearing vulnerable. Their emotional depth becomes evident in their strong loyalty and care for those they protect.  

3. **Eights are only concerned with control.**  
   While Eights value control, their primary focus is on ensuring safety and fairness, both for themselves and those they care about. Their desire for control is rooted in a need to prevent harm or betrayal.  

4. **Most Eights are men.**  
   There are just as many female Eights as male Eights, but societal norms tend to socialize women differently. Female Eights are often criticized for being "too much" or "too intense," leading to more frequent feedback that they should "tone it down." This external pressure can make it harder for female Eights to embrace and own their assertiveness.
